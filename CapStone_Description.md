## Description for Capstone Exercise for Introduction to TensorFlow API in Python
### CONTEXT:

Bringing it all together:

In this exercise, we collate all the functions together and build a multi layer neural network. For this, the following steps are performed

1. Define the input layer, the hidden layers and the output layer.
2. Define the weights and biases for the first and second layer, the activation function after the first layer and the activation function for the output layer.
3. Setup the cost function, optimizer and accuracy calculation.
4. Write the for loop for starting the session and training the network, also printing the epoch, accuracy and predicted v/s actual variables.
