## Chapter 1 - Setting Up Interactive Web Maps
   * Lesson 1.1 - Introduction to leaflet
     * A learning objective: Create a basic interactive web map in R using the `leaflet` and `htmlwidgets` packages.
   * Lesson 1.2 - Working with Map tiles
     * A learning objective: Tweak the base map in `leaflet` using provider tiles, such as those on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
   * Lesson 1.3 - Setting the Default Map View
     * A learning objective: Create a default map by centering on a certain location, setting a default zoom level, and adding markers or pins to your map.
## Chapter 2 - Plotting Points
   * Lesson 2.1 - Introduction to IPEDS Data
     * A learning objective: Create a map step-by-step to gain a better understanding of how your data will dictate the map you create.
   * Lesson 2.2 - Mapping California Colleges
     * A learning objective: Pan and plot a point on a map using the IPEDS case study.
   * Lesson 2.3 - Labels and Pop-ups
     * A learning objective: Center, zoom in, and plot points on the IPEDS map.
   * Lesson 2.4 - Color Coding Colleges
     * A learning objective: Enhance the appearance of the IPEDS map by changing the color palette of the markers and adding a map legend.
## Chapter 3 - Groups, Layers, and Extras
   * Lesson 3.1 - The Leaflet Extras Package
     * A learning objective: Add search capabilities to your map! Find a location by typing it in a search bar, plus find the name of a location by clicking on a point in your map.
   * Lesson 3.2 - Overlay Groups
     * A learning objective: Clarify how your data is distributed by adding toggles to group data on your map.
   * Lesson 3.3 - Base Groups
     * A learning objective: Give your user control over their view by adding toggles between base maps.
   * Lesson 3.4 - Pieces of Flair
     * A learning objective: Create an advanced and searchable map using special features like clustering.
## Chapter 4 - Plotting Polygons
   * Lesson 4.1 - Spatial Data
     * A learning objective: Define your map boundaries by performing a spatial join.
   * Lesson 4.2 - Mapping Polygons
     * A learning objective: Perform exploratory data analysis using polygons to examine data missingness.
   * Lesson 4.3 - Putting it All Together
     * A learning objective: Use interactive web maps to explore and understand the properties of data.
